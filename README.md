# Chess
## Description

Chess is an abstract strategy board game for two players which involves no hidden information 
and no elements of chance. It is played on a square game board called a chessboard containing 
64 squares arranged in an 8Ã—8 grid. The players, referred to as "White" and "Black", each control 
sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns; each 
type of piece has a different pattern of movement. An enemy piece may be "captured" (removed from 
the board) by moving one's own piece onto the square it occupies; the object of the game is to 
"checkmate" (threaten with inescapable capture) the enemy king. There are also several ways 
a game can end in a draw.

The game is created entirely in C++ and is fully functional, although not yet complete. Features 
such as castling, draw, and similar are still missing.
